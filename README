My best friend said to me that she is afraid of being an ordinary person forever. 
I record my reply in the cartoon made by HTML, CSS, and javascript 
because I will take a Data Visualisation class.

For me, I think data visualisation is not information visualisation
if you only show people data but without your own interpretation. 
In this situation, people who read your story or data-science-related data might have lots of information generated in their mind, 
which is not the power of my data but is the power of the reader's existed knowledge. 
They try to interpret my data. Good data visualisation is like telling a good story or passing information 
by learning a lot of things then compress and select them to put them on the scene 
making people can notice them. However, I wanna emphasize it is not information visualisation. 
So I think the best data visualisation must be matched with the author's interpretation. 
With interpretation, data visualisation can be regarded as information visualisation. 
And the information is really what I look forward to.

To be honest, my cartoon is only a data visualisation. 
I think that I have to write more words to prove and show 
that life is better than anything (money, power, and knowledge).

By the way, what will you say to your friend, 
if they told you that they are afraid of being an ordinary person? 
You can use my code, insert your words, and you can have this simple dialogue cartoon.
